IEEEMADC Submission

Preparation is a very important thing in our life. As students it is essential to being prepared for the classes because it can be truly succeed if everyone is well prepared for the lessons before attend to the classes or lecturers. Therefore our team members decided to design a mobile app to notify students to prepare for their next class. Then students can read the relevant text or  search for relevant information before the class which will really help to change the fundamental nature of the class. 

Hence this app is very much useful mainly for the students who need to be notified about their lessons before they attend to the class. They can simply add their lessons plan for each class and they will be notified about next class lesson beforehand. 
To build our application we have used Android Studio as our integrated development environment, Android SDK as software development kit and JAVA as the programming language.
